1. I have noticed that the friends div in the in the profile page is not updating in real-time when we accept a friend request. For example: When Alice send a request to Bob in bob's profile page suddenly appears Alice's request in the pending div. Once accepted it moves to the friends div in Bob's page automatically but it does not update instantly in Alice's page

2. Inside the chrome devtools under issues tab I can see this warning when I am in any page

```
A form field element should have an id or name attribute
A form field element has neither an id nor a name attribute. This might prevent the browser from correctly autofilling the form.

To fix this issue, add a unique id or name attribute to a form field. This is not strictly needed, but still recommended even if you have an autocomplete attribute on the same element.
